# Detection and Response
## Objective
[Brief Objective - Remove this afterwards]

I impleted a Detection and Response lab to simulate real world cybersecurity incidents and strenghen defensive capabilities. The primary objective of this lab was to enhanced my skills in threat detection, log analysis, and incident response using industry standard tools such as SIEMS, Suricata and WIreshark. I was able to replicate attack scenerios, practice the incident response lifestyle, from detection and cointainment to eradication and recovery and developed custom detection rules to identify various threat behaviours. The lab also allowed me to validate security configurations. This hands-on experience significantly improved my ability to analyze malicious activity, respond effectively to incidents and reinforced overall cybersecurity rediness.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
