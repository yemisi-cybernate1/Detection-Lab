# Detection and Response
## Objective

I impleted a Detection and Response lab to simulate real world cybersecurity incidents and strenghen defensive capabilities. The primary objective of this lab was to enhanced my skills in threat detection, log analysis, and incident response using industry standard tools such as SIEMS, Suricata and WIreshark. I was able to replicate attack scenerios, practice the incident response lifestyle, from detection and cointainment to eradication and recovery and developed custom detection rules to identify various threat behaviours. The lab also allowed me to validate security configurations. This hands-on experience significantly improved my ability to analyze malicious activity, respond effectively to incidents and reinforced overall cybersecurity rediness.

### Skills Learned

- Threat Detection & analysis
- SIEMS proficiency
- Documentation and reporting
- Log analysis
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Wireshark- I analyzed Network packets and Identified suspicious traffic patterns
- SIEM Platforms (e.g., Splunk) – I explored log ingestion pipelines and created basic search queries to identify suspicious events and alerts.
- YARA- I wrote and tested custom YARA rules to detect specific malware patterns and suspicious file behavior.
- SQL- I used SQL-like queries to gather system-level data and identify unusual or unauthorized activity on endpoints.
- Snort/ Suricata– These tools allowed me to detect and respond to intrusion attempts by analyzing live network traffic.
- Google Chronicle – I used this cloud-native SIEM to ingest and analyze logs at scale. It helped me investigate threats faster by leveraging Chronicle's high-speed search and threat intelligence.
- Log Forwarder – I set up and configured a log forwarder to securely collect and transmit logs from multiple sources to the SIEM.
